# Partner Metrics

Partner Metrics is an open-source project providing you with metrics of your app, theme and affiliate revenue from the Shopify Partner program. Currently it calculates metrics based on monthly and yearly subscriptions, one-time charges and usage charges from Shopify.

This project is not officially related to Shopify in any way.

## Usage

Partner Metrics was created by [@forsbergplustwo](@forsbergplustwo), and will remain free to use at:

##### https://partnermetrics.io

## Development

### Upgrading

The app in this repo was recently upgraded to Rails 7. If you had the earlier version running locally, you can upgrade by performing the following actions on your existing local app:

```
bin/rails db:migrate
bin/rails db:encryption:init
bin/rails create_initial_imports
bin/rails migrate_partner_api_credentials
```

Note: We recommend deleting your existing metrics data and re-importing to take advantage of improvements to churn calculations + yearly subscriptions support.

### First time setup

1. Setup dependencies, environment & database: `bin/setup`
2. Setup encrypted attributes support: `bin/rails db:encryption:init`
3. Create and add credentials `bin/rails credentials:edit` (use config/credentials.sample.yml as template)
4. Start web server and sidekiq workers with: `bin/dev`

Visit `localhost:4000`

To run tests:

```bash
bin/rails test

# including system tests
bin/rails test:all
```
